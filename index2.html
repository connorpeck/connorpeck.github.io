           <h4> Photographer </h4>
           <p>  Photography has allowed me to meet incredible people and connect with them on some of the most meaningful days of their lives. It has also afforded me opportunities to combine a number of my other passions like music and the outdoors in one career.


The highlight of my photo career was two years ago when I got to put together a full brand and creative package for a band I not only admire but have a personal connection to. I was asked to shoot the album cover, design print materials and promotional photos for their upcoming album release with Epitaph records. It meant a great deal to me to have an established label see my work and want to hire me. They trusted me enough to give me full creative freedom on this project, something I never thought Iâ€™d achieve in this field.

           <h4> Cafe Manager </h4>
           <p> This position forced me to learn a lot of new skills in a very short amount of time. The biggest lesson I learned as a manager is to lead with empath. At the end of the day coffee is coffee. We aren't saving lives but we are adding value to someone's day even if it is just a brief interaction. This means making sure all employees feel happy and empowered in their position which I helped them achieve through compassionate leadership and training them on every step of the process not just how to steam milk or pull a perfect shot of espresso. It was important to me that everyone was able to utilize their own skill sets and bring those to the table so they could perform at their best.  </p>

           <h4> Barista </h4>
           <p> In this role I was able to expand my knowledge of specialty coffee over four months of intense training on espresso theory. This training gave me the ability to not only be knowledgeable about the industry but also showed me how much goes into making a single cup of coffee from the farmers growing the beans, the roasting process, all the way to brewing a cup and serving it.Starting at Spyhouse cafe was one of my first experiences in working as a member of a team and it is because of the interpersonal skills I obtained that I was able to move up in the industry and take on a management role at Parallel.
